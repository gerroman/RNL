# RNL

Author: Roman N. Lee

A set of simple tools for vectors and gamma-matrices.

### Disclaimer

The RNL`* packages were written long time ago (some twenty years ago), when the author knew a little about effective programming in Mathematica. They were updated from time to time, but still they contain a lot of inefficient code.

### Installation

Open *Packages* subfolder in the terminal and run `math -script makeRNL.m`  or `wolfram -script makeRNL.m` for MMA v14.0-  or MMA v14.1+. respectively.

### Usage

Check *Examples* subfolder for examples.
